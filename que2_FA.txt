The movie's plot intricately weaves around the journey of young Ashish as he navigates the complexities of growing up and transitioning into adulthood. Amidst his coming-of-age experiences, a series of conflicts unfold, each adding layers to the narrative. However, at the heart of the film lies a central conflict: Ashish's relentless pursuit to win the affection of his "love interest," Shrushti, a fellow classmate. As Ashish grapples with the challenges of adolescence and the pursuit of love, the film delves into themes of identity, friendship, and family.
In addition to his romantic pursuit of Shrushti, Ashish contends with a myriad of other challenges that shape the conflicts in his life. Firstly, his grandfather's battle with alcohol addiction casts a shadow over the family, adding a layer of emotional strain and instability to their dynamic. Secondly, the weight of his family's precarious financial situation looms large, forcing Ashish to confront the harsh realities of poverty and its impact on his aspirations and future. Furthermore, the discrimination he faces as a Dalit further exacerbates his struggles, highlighting the pervasive societal prejudices that he must navigate on a daily basis. These intersecting factors not only compound Ashish's personal turmoil but also underscore the broader social and systemic injustices that he confronts as he strives to carve out his place in the world.
