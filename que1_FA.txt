We were drawn to "Borya," the protagonist's close companion and best friend, as our favorite character in the film.
Borya keenly noticed the budding attraction between Ashish and Shrusti before anyone else did. Without delay, he seized the opportunity to divulge this revelation to everyone around, ensuring that no detail of Ashish's crush went unnoticed or unremarked upon.
Borya is quite mischievous, often finding himself in various scrapes and shenanigans.
Despite his mischievous nature and humble demeanor, Borya proves to be an exceptional friend to Ashish. He invests considerable effort into uncovering the address of Ashish's crush, unable to resist teasing Ashish into treating him with a "Bafr cha gola" in exchange for his efforts. This playful exchange also highlights Borya's deep love for food.
As the film progresses, Borya impulsively carves the names of Ashish and Shrushti onto a bench, revealing his innocent and naive notions of love and what he believes would impress her. Despite the potential consequences, this bold act showcases Borya's profound friendship and willingness to take risks for his friends.
As the story unfolds, Borya undergoes noticeable growth, maturing into a more responsible young boy. This transformation becomes evident when tensions escalate following the collapse of the mosque, initially causing him to harbor hostility towards his Muslim friend. However, he quickly comes to the realization of his friend's innocence and recognizes the significance of their mutual support for one another.
